textalt-book-system
===================

A collection of tools and a web application which are used to operate my family's textbook store.  Some parts of is are generally useful, such as those which parse standard data formats, and mine data from various sources (more details on these in the repository).  Also, a tool for employing a "mob" of rackspace cloud machines to scrape data from data sources with an IP-based rate limit.
